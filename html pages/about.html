				The darkest hour of
				the night came just
				before the dawn" "When
				you want something,
				all the universe
				conspires to help you
				achieve it" "When we
				strive to become
				better than we are,
				everything around us
				becomes better too"
				"When you possess
				great treasures within
				you and try to tell
				others of them, seldom
				are you believed"
				"Making decisions is
				only the beginning of
				things. When someone
				makes a decision, he
				is really diving into
				a strong current that
				will carry him to the
				places he had never
				dreamed of, when he
				first made the
				decision" "The secret
				is here in the present
				if you pay attention
				to the present, you
				can improve upon it.
				And if you can improve
				upon the present, what
				comes later will also
				be better. Forget
				about the future, and
				live each day
				according to the
				teachings, be
				confident that God
				loves his children.
				Each day in itself
				brings with it an
				eternity"
